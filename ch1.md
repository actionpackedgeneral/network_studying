# Overview

Most SOHO PC's are connected to:

1. telephone network
   - publicly switched telephone network (PSTN)
   - integrated services digital netowrk (ISDN)
2. cable television nettwork (CATV)

These provide access to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) network.
At work, the PC is connected to either a:

1.  Local Area Network (LAN)
2.  Enterprise wide private network

Each enterprise wide private network is composed of multiple LANs connected by an inter-site backbone network. The networks utilize the same operational mode and protocols as the Internet itself, so they are known as **intranet**.

_Wireless Networks_ and _entertainment networks_ both use basic radio to provide an access point to the Internet.

With compression, networks support rich set of applications involving multiple media types.

# Application and networking terminology

## Data Types and their characteristics

1. Text

- Unformatted plaintext
- formatted text, richtext and enables pages and complete documents to be created
- hypertext, enables web pages to be created with an integrated set of documents (each comprising formatted text) with defined linkages between them

2. Images
   - Computer-generated images
   - digitized images
3. Video
   - sequence of digitized images, each of which is called a _frame_. With broadcast television, the video signal is in analog form and must be converted into digital. There are a number of _digitization formats_ that specify the ways to do this conversion based on the screen size. To obtain a moving picture, the frames are played out at a rate determined by the format.
4. Audio
   All audio is generated in _analog_ form. Before the signal can be stored in a computer, it must be converted using an electric circuit called **analog-to-digital converter**, which involves sampling the amplitiude of the speech/audio signal at regular time intervals. Higher sampling : better quality.

Data can either be continuous or block mode. In continuous data, the bit rate of the communications channel that is used must be compatible with the sourcec data that is being generated.
