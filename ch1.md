# Overview

Most SOHO PC's are connected to:

1. telephone network
   - publicly switched telephone network (PSTN)
   - integrated services digital netowrk (ISDN)
2. cable television nettwork (CATV)

These provide access to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) network.
At work, the PC is connected to either a:

1.  Local Area Network (LAN)
2.  Enterprise wide private network

Each enterprise wide private network is composed of multiple LANs connected by an inter-site backbone network. The networks utilize the same operational mode and protocols as the Internet itself, so they are known as **intranet**.

*Wireless Networks* and *entertainment networks* both use basic radio to provide an access point to the Internet.
